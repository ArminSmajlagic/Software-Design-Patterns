# Creational patterns

### Definition

These design patterns are all about instantiation process of objects. 
They try to abstract the process of how objects are created,composed, and represented.
There is important to remark that there is differentiation in creational patterns. 
We have object creation (where we delegate instantiation process to another object) and class creation patterns (uses inheritance to vary the class that is instantiated).

Creational patterns found their place in more complex systems which depend a lot on inheritance and composition.
They should hide the way how the classes are being created, which gives us flexibility about how objects are created, what is getting created, who creates them and when.
And very important note is that we can configure system with all sorts of objects, and perform the configuration staticaly (at compile-time) or dynamicaly (at run-time).
Final important remark is that creational patterns can be complementary (build on each other).
