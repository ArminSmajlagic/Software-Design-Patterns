# Structural patterns

### Definition

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed into larger structures.
Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.
One example is multi-inheritance where we can combine multiple classes into one which results in sub-class that combines the properties of its parent classes.
Good use case structural patterns is for making independently developed class libraries work together.
Structural object patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality. 
Many structural patterns are related to some degree.
